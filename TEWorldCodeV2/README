Instructions

From a unix command line:

1.  Navigate to TEWorldSims directory:
	cd ~/DropBox/TEWorldSims

2.  Create your own subdirectory in which to conduct your experiment:
	e.g:  mkdir SKExp03
    Use your own intitials, not mine.  Don't clobber others' work.

3.  Navigate into that directory:
	e.g. cd SKExp03
    Change into YOUR (not MY) directory.

4.  Make sure it's empty:
	ls

5.  Copy parameters file:
        cp ../../TEWorldCode/parameters.py .

6.  Edit parameters file.

7.  Run the simulation:
	python2.7 ../../TEWorldCode/TESim.py 100
    The number is the number of times you want to run the simulation.
    If you run it multiple times each set of outputs will clobber the
    previous...hope you are in your own directory (not MINE)....
