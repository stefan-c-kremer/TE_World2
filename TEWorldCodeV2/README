# Instructions

From a Unix command line:

1.  Create your own subdirectory in which to conduct your experiment:
	e.g:  `mkdir SKExp03`
    Use your own intitials, not mine.  Don't clobber others' work.

2.  Navigate into that directory:
	e.g. `cd SKExp03`
    Change into YOUR (not MY) directory.

3.  Make sure it's empty:
	
`ls`

4.  Copy parameters file:
        
`cp ../TEWorldCodeV2/parameters.py .`

5.  Edit parameters file.

6.  Run the simulation:
	
`python2.7 ../TEWorldCodeV2/TESim.py 100`
    
    
> The number is the number of times you want to run the simulation. 
If you run it multiple times each set of outputs will clobber the previous ... I hope you are in your own directory (not MINE).
